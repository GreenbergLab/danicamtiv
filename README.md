# Danicamtiv

This repository contains the R code to re-produce all figures and most analysis for our danicamtiv paper. The whole project repository including the data files is 114 GB total size, ~41 GB zipped, and is deposited on Zenodo.

[https://zenodo.org/records/12636349](https://zenodo.org/records/12636349)

The main purpose of this repository is to supply the renv files to reproduce the R renvironment/packages versions used for reproducibility. 

Most files have been /.gitignored except for code related files (.R, .lock, etc) due to file size limitations.
